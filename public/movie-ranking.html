<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Fall of the House of Usher</h3>
<p>The twists, turns and backstory were maddening.</p>

<h3>La Lorona</h3>
<p>I am a die hard horror fan. So, I just like it.</p>

<h3>The Nun</h3>
<p>I've always loved when horror is filmed in a church. Gives it a sweet and exciting edge.</p>
