<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Emeka, Precious Esther but friends call me <i>"Mara"</i> from my Igbo name <i>"Amarachi"</i>. I am the first born of five (5) children in a family of seven (7) and it has been one long yet beautiful experience.</p>

<p>It may seem cliche but I love learning new things and I look forward to a good challenge. I am currently a lecturer in a prestigious universtiy and I must say, it has been swell. More on that in the future, I hope</p>

<p>In the nearest future, there will definitely be more details about me on here but for now, I'm headed back to my very detailed and interesting tutorial.</p>

<b>Ciao</b>
